# ChangeSkin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/games647/ChangeSkin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/games647/ChangeSkin)

## Description

This plugin allows your players to change their skins by command. These skins have to be downloaded from Mojang, because Minecraft clients only accept from Mojang signed skins. But you can choose every skin that another minecraft user currently has.

Moreover it will be possible to set a custom standard skin. If you want to, this plugin can set this standard skin for all players who still have the default steve or alex skin.
